AEX_HEX v1.0
Agent Experience Corpus and Capability Signaling
Status: Experimental
Version: 1.0
1. Purpose
AEX_HEX defines the experience corpus for synthetic agents.
It provides a structured, portable, privacy-preserving record of:
• what domains an agent has operated in
• how much experience it has accumulated
• how recently and consistently it has performed relevant tasks
• what traits, capabilities, and operational markers it exhibits
AEX_HEX is the phenotypic layer of the AEX protocol family.
It answers the question:
“What kind of agent are you?”
AEX_HEX complements:
• AEX_ID (identity & lineage)
• AEX_REP (authority & delegation)
• AEX_DEX (behavioral reliability)
Together, these layers enable agents to identify, trust, authorize, and select one another.
2. Design Principles
2.1 Phenotypic, Not Biographical
HEX records evidence of capability, not task content.
It does not reveal:
• client identities
• private dat
